1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Ans. A new .git file is created in that repository which then stores the metadata on the files in the repository. One needs to create as otherwise it is only a normal directory and doesn't store any metadata that git uses.

2)How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
Ans. Staging area is a behind the scenes place where the files are grouped together before commiting. This allows the commit command to have more flexibility and one can commit per logical change in our project.

3)How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
Ans. Staging area can only include those files where the logical change has been made.

4)What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Ans. If I wanted to create multiple versions of the same project say for different users, branches would be very helpful. They would also be helpful if I was not sure about integrating a new feature, using branches would help me in organizing without comprimising my original code.

5)How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
Ans. Diagrams helps one in making clear the relationships between the various commits and also tells us the path to any commit by choosing a branch.
